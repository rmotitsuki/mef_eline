[UNRELEASED] - Under development
********************************

Changed
=======
- Updated python environment installation from 3.9 to 3.11
- Updated test dependencies

[2023.2.0] - 2024-02-16
***********************

[2023.2.0] - 2024-02-16
***********************

Added
=====
- Added a UI button for redeploying an EVC.
- UNI tag_type are now accepted as string.
- Event ``kytos/mef_eline.evcs_loaded`` gets published during NApp setup
- EVCs now listen to ``switch.interface.(link_up|link_down|created|deleted)`` events for activation/deactivation
- Circuits with a vlan range are supported now. The ranges follows ``list[list[int]]`` format and both UNIs vlan should have the same ranges.
- Usage of special vlans ``"untagged"`` and ``"any"`` now send an event to each Interface.
- Added ``UNI_STATE_CHANGE_DELAY`` which configures the time for ``mef_eline`` to wait on link state flaps and update EVCs with last updated event.
- Added support for ``not_ownership`` to dynamic path constraints.
- Added support for ``not_ownership`` on main UI interface.

Changed
=======
- EVCs will try to maintain their current_path on link status changes
- UNIs now will use and free tags from ``Interface.available_tags``.
- UNI tag_type is changed to string from 1, 2 and 3 values to ``"vlan"``, ``"vlan_qinq"`` and ``"mpls"`` respectively.
- Add ``set_vlan`` only if UNI A vlan and UNI z vlan are different.
- Updated ``openapi.yml``, ``Tag`` now can accept ``array`` as ``value``.
- Updated UI interface to support list of ranges of VLANs.
- Improved log for invalid traces by adding ``From EVC(evc_id) named 'evc_name'``
- An inactive and enabled EVC will be redeploy if an attribute from ``attributes_requiring_redeploy`` is updated.
- If a KytosEvent can't be put on ``buffers.app`` during ``setup()``, it'll make the NApp to fail to start
- Disjointedness algorithm now takes into account switches, excepting the UNIs switches. Unwanted switches have the same value as the unwanted links.
- Archived EVCs are not longer kept in memory. They can only be found in the database.

Deprecated
==========
- Deleted emition of ``kytos/.*.link_available_tags`` event. ``kytos/core.interface_tags`` event through Interface takes its place.

General Information
===================
- ``scripts/vlan_type_string.py`` can be used to update the collection ``evcs`` by changing ``tag_type`` from integer to string.
- ``scripts/redeploy_evpls_same_vlans.py`` can be used to redeploy symmetric (same UNI vlans) EVPLs in batch.

Fixed
=====
- required at least one circuit_id on ``POST v2/evc/metadata``
- fixed race condition in ``failover_path`` when handling simultaneous Link Down events leading to inconsistencies on some EVC
- fixed sdntrace_cp check_trace ``current_path`` comparison with the expected UNI order
- fixed ``DynamicPathManager.get_paths`` return value when ``pathfinder`` returns a request error
- ``failover_path`` will get removed if it exists during a redeploy

[2023.1.0] - 2023-06-27
***********************

Added
=====
- Added more content keys ``evc_id, name, metadata, active, enabled, uni_a, uni_z`` to events from ``mef_eline``
- Added ``uni_a`` and ``uni_z`` to ``attributes_requiring_redeploy``
- Added ``metadata`` to EVC schema
- Allow the creation of ``any`` and ``untagged`` EVC.
- Added API request ``POST /v2/evc/metadata`` to add metadata to EVCs
- Added API request ``DELETE /v2/evc/metadata/<key>`` to delete metadata from EVCs
- Subscribed to new event ``kytos/of_multi_table.enable_table`` as well as publishing ``kytos/mef_eline.enable_table`` required to set a different ``table_id`` to flows.
- Added ``settings.TABLE_GROUP_ALLOWED`` set containning the allowed table groups, for now ``'evpl', 'epl'`` are supported.
- Added ui support for primary and secondary constraints
- Added ``QUEUE_ID`` to ``settings.py`` to be the default value for EVCs ``"queue_id"``
- Exposed default ``SPF_ATTRIBUTE`` on settings.py, the default value is still `"hop"`. This value will be parametrized whenever ``primary_constraints.spf_attribute`` or ``secondary_constraints.spf_attribute`` isn't set

Changed
=======
- Moved request circuit ``k-button`` out of k-accordion-item since it's mandatory
- The traces being check rely on ``type``: ``last`` to be considered valid.
- ``dl_vlan`` value is mapped to an integer in range [1, 4095] for the ``/traces`` requests to ``sdntrace_cp``
- Augmented ``GET /v2/evc/`` to accept parameters ``metadata.key=item``
- Upgraded ``openapi-core`` to ``0.16.6`` from ``0.14.5``.
- Changed ``openapi.yml`` to be used as validation spec for request related methods ``updated()``, ``create_schedule()`` and ``update_schedule()``.
- ``mef_eline`` now supports table group settings from ``of_multi_table``
- Changed increasing amount of flows being sent, now it is fixed. Amount can be changed on ``settings.BATCH_SIZE``
- Changed UI constraints default values to pass the spec validation
- Changed intra-switch EVC with a disabled switch or interface is not longer allowed to be created
- Adapted ``mef_eline`` to ordered endpoints in a link. Endpoints for flow creation are compared with switch ids to overcome ordered endpoint.
- EVCs UNI will be checked for disabled interfaces so the EVC is disabled as well.
- ``primary_constraints.spf_attribute`` and ``secondary_constraints.spf_attribute`` will only be set in the database if they've been set in the request.
- Changed UI spf_attribute to allow it to be ``default``, meaning an unset value

General Information
===================
- ``./scripts/002_unset_spf_attribute.py`` is a script to unset both ``primary_constraints.spf_attribute`` and ``secondary_constraints.spf_attribute``. On version 2022.3, this value was explicitly set, so you can use this script to unset this value if you want that ``spf_attribute`` follows the default ``settings.SPF_ATTRIBUTE`` value.
- ``@rest`` endpoints are now run by ``starlette/uvicorn`` instead of ``flask/werkzeug``.
- Replaced ``@validate`` with ``@validate_openapi`` from kytos core

Fixed
=====
- fixed ``minimum_flexible_hits`` EVC attribute to be persistent
- fixed attribute list for path constraints to include ``reliability``
- fixed unnecessary redeploy of an intra-switch EVC on link up events
- fixed ``check_list_traces`` to work with the new version of SDN traces
- fixed updating EVC to be an intra-switch with invalid switch or interface
- fixed EVC UI list to sort VLAN A and VLAN Z fields to acts as number
- fixed non-redeployment of circuit when patching with ``{"queue_id":null}``


[2022.3.1] - 2023-02-14

[2022.3.0] - 2023-01-23
***********************

Added
=====
- Added ``service_level`` EVC attribute to set the service network convergence level, the higher the better
- EVCs with higher service level priority will be handled first during network convergence, including when running ``sdntrace_cp`` consistency checks.
- Added support for constrained paths for primary dynamic paths and failover paths, ``primary_constraints`` and ``secondary_constraints`` can be set via API.
- Added ``service_level`` UI component on ``k-toolbar`` and made it editable.
- Added ``sb_priority`` UI component on ``k-toolbar``.
- Added ``queue_id`` UI component on ``k-toolbar``.
- Documented ``GET /v2/evc?archived`` query arg on openapi.yml
- Added ``flow_removed_at`` and ``updated_at`` parameters in EVC.
- Added ``execution_rounds`` in EVC to be used by the consistency check. 
- Added logging message for ``link_up`` events.

Changed
=======
- ``priority`` has been renamed to ``sb_priority`` (southbound priority), ``./scripts/001_rename_priority.py`` can be used to update EVC documents accordingly
- ``GET /v2/evc?archived=true`` will only return archived EVCs
- k-toolbar UI component won't expose UNI tag type anymore, if a tag value is set, it'll assume it's tag type vlan.
- Consistency check uses the new ``PUT /traces`` endpoint from `sdntrace_cp` for bulk requests.

Removed
=======
- ``priority`` is no longer supported in the API spec

Fixed
=====
- Removed the failover path after removing flows
- Removed failover flows when an EVC gets deleted

***********************

Added
=====

- Optimize list of circuits filters
- Migrated persistency from kytos/storehouse to MongoDB (integration with pymongo)
- ELineController and DB models
- Retries to handle database ``AutoReconnect`` exception.
- ``DynamicPathManager.get_disjoint_paths`` to calculates the maximum disjoint
  paths from a given "unwanted_path" (typically the currently in use path) using
  the approach described in blueprint EP029
- Fully dynamic EVCs can now benefit from Failover Paths (``failover_path``),
  which improves significantly the convergence performance when facing link down
- Refactored Link Down handler to dispatch Kytos Events to handle traditional
  EVCs (EVCs that are not eligible for failover) more efficiently.

Changed
=======

- ``DynamicPathManager.get_paths`` to also supports ``max_paths`` parameter and
  then request more paths from pathfinder (default to 2, which is also the
  default on pathfinder)
