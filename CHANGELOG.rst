[2.2.2] - 2018-10-15
********************

Fixed
=====
- Fixed error when creating a circuit with scheduling and without `start_date`
   (#79 and #80)

[2.2.1] - 2018-09-06
********************
Added
=====
- Added endpoint to allow update circuit informations.
- Added structure to support ci integration: unittests, linter, tox and
  scrutinizer.
- Added some tests for the class already created.
- Added some LinkProtection features:
  - Added method to handle when links goes up or end_maintenance.
  - Added method to handle when links goes down or under_maintenance.
  - When primary_path and backup_path goes down or under_maintenance and
    `dynamic_backup_path` is setted as True a dynamic path is choosed using the
    PathFinder NApp when the primary and backup path is both down or not
    setted.
  - When the primary_path is down and backup_path exists and is UP the circuit
    will change from primary_path to backup_path.
  - When the primary_path change from DOWN to UP the circuits will change to
    the primary_path.
  - When the circuit is disabled the circuit will not be deployed.
  - Added method to looking for links affected was created using the python
    `set` class to be more fast to find the links affected.

Changed
=======
- Change deploy to use primary_path, backup_path or a dynamic_path.
- Improved the Schedule to use advanced python scheduler (APScheduler) library.
Thanks @ajoaoff for recommends this library.
- The attribute circuit_scheduler in the EVC class should have some instances
of CircuitScheduler, this instances will have the information about the
scheduler informations.

Fixed
=====
- Fixed the create circuit method when sending a invalid request
- Fixed some linter warnings.
